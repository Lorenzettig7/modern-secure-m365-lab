Subject: Upcoming Microsoft 365 security updates

Hello team,

On **[DATE]**, we will be implementing security updates to our Microsoft 365 environment. These changes are designed to reduce the risk of account compromise and protect sensitive information.

**What’s changing**
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) enforcement for sign-ins
- Additional protections for older/legacy sign-in methods
- Device compliance requirements for certain access scenarios

**What you may notice**
- You may be prompted to approve sign-ins using Microsoft Authenticator
- Some older email clients may stop working if they use legacy authentication

**What you need to do**
- Ensure Microsoft Authenticator is installed on your phone
- If you use older email clients, be prepared to reconfigure them or switch to Outlook

If you have questions or run into issues, please contact **[SUPPORT CONTACT]**.

Thank you,
[NAME / IT Team]
